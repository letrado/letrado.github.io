## Week Two - Journal

### Ruby topics you've mastered
*  I have a good grasp on the big picture of most assignments.
*  I understand the function of the server file.  It handles requests from the web browser and acts as a go between
   with other files in our project such as the html.erb file.
*  The html.erb file is our output page that formats what our webpage will look like
*  The setup file creates our database table.  It does this by using the Active Record Library.
*  The database file maintains and organizes the specific data for our project. 
*  The class file creates our main class or classes for the project.  Sometimes, specific methods are defined in 
   in this file in order to keep a more orderly server file.
*  I have a decent grasp of how Ruby can be used in an html.erb file.  
  

### Ruby topics you're struggling with
*  I am struggling with the minutia of creating functional code on my own.
*  I am still trying to discern the return values and object types so I can determine appropriate methods to use
   in certain situations.
*  I feel like I need to practice writing functional code blocks using various methods.
*  I am not totally comfortable with how regular expressions are used but I am not totally lost either

### GitHub and its shiny buttons
*  Still unsure if I am creating folders in the right places in Github
*  I would like to learn how to use the command line for GIthub actions


### Personal retrospective
* I am working hard and am continuing to stay focused.  I am okay knowing that I am not going to understand
  everything completely.  I am doing my best to just keep trying hard.  I am coming to grips with trusting 
  process.  Every moment of every day I am just trying to focus on the material at hand and accept that although
  I am not mastering everytrhing, I am still retaining large amounts of new knowledge.

### Things about the class that have surprised you
*  I am surprised at how helpful my fellow students have been.  I feel lucky to be in a class with others who are 
  more advanced than me because they are valuable additional sources of knowledge for me.  I am grateful at their
  willingness to lend a hand in my learning process.
