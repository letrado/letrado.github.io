## Week One - Journal

### Ruby topics you've mastered
*  understand what the main objects are -- numbers, strings, arrays, hashes
*  understand how methods are called on objects
*  basic understanding of how control structures work using if, else, elsif statements
*  understand how ruby operators work and what is the difference between assignment and equality operators
*  understand how ruby collections--arrays and hashes--are structured 
*  have a basic understanding of how Ruby loops work--e.g. the each method--but need more practice in constructing      useful and functional blocks
*  basic understanding of how to build a functional server
  

### Ruby topics you're struggling with
* how to access data in a sorted fashion that I can output to a webpage
* when to use class vs. local variables vs. instance variables
* need more practice constructing useful and functioning blocks
* need better understanding of how and why to construct useful methods

### GitHub and its shiny buttons
*  I have a basic understanding of the function of GitHub as an essential developer tool for version control--i.e. don't mess with functioning code so if changes/improvements are to be made, those changes should be made where they can do no harm.
*  GitHub provides a useful way of tracking and documenting the history of a code project in a way that allows a developer to easily understand and view changes.
*  I am having trouble navigating the GitHub tool.  I am having trouble figuring out where to create branches, and how to create pull requests in the right place.


### Personal retrospective
*  I am engaged and putting in the time.  That is the most important part.
*  Although I am frustrated with how fast I am picking things up, when I step back, I knew this was going to be the case.  I am present enough to understand this is normal and remind myself to just keep focusing.
*  I like our cohort.  Everybody has a pretty positive and collaborative attitude so far.  Plus the fact that we have two levels of students can be helpful for those of us who have less experience.

### Things about the class that have surprised you
*  Even though I knew we were going to get into coding right off the bat, I am surprised at the complex nature of the code we are starting with.  I assumed there would be a week or two of practicing writing methods, creating functional loops, calling methods, etc. Instead in our first week we are writing code to make servers for multi-page websites that allows users to manipulate large data sets.  That was a surprise.  I figured that would be around week three to five.
